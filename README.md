# Bullet Dodge

This is a small game made in Processing. It is not a fully fleshed game, but was a fun small project I worked on to practice my Processing skills because I think it's a very fun language.

## Description
This is a game where the player maneuvers a circle to avoid being hit by bullets that are flying in from the top and left side of the screen. The player starts with 5 lives and each collision takes a life. The score is calculated based on the amount of time the player has stayed alive. Since bullets keep being added, all 5 lives will inevitably get used. 

## Design Structure
This does not conform to any particular design protocol besides object oriented programming. There is an interface for the Bullet class included to help with structure.
